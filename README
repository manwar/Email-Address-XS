Email-Address-XS
================

This module implements RFC 2822 parser and formatter of email groups
or addresses. It parses input string from email headers which contain
a list of email addresses or a group of email addresses (like From,
To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate string
values for those headers from list of email addresses objects.

Parser and formatter functionality are implemented in XS and use
shared code from Dovecot IMAP server.

It is a drop-in replacement for the Email::Address module which has
several security issues. E.g. issue CVE-2015-7686 (Algorithmic
complexity vulnerability), which allows remote attackers to cause
denial of service, is still present in Email::Address version 1.908.

Email::Address::XS module was created to finally fix CVE-2015-7686.

Existing applications that use Email::Address module could be easily
switched to Email::Address::XS module. In most cases only changing
'use Email::Address' to 'use Email::Address::X' and replacing every
'Email::Address' occurrence with 'Email::Address::XS' is sufficient.

So unlike Email::Address, this module does not use regular expressions
for parsing but instead native XS implementation parses input string
sequentially according to RFC 2822 grammar.

Additionally it has support also for named groups and so can be use
instead of the Email::Address::List module.
